# Harvey OS Security Model

This document outlines the security model for Harvey OS, including its threat model, core security principles, and validation procedures. It serves as a guide for developers and contributors to ensure that security is an integral part of the Harvey OS design and implementation.

## 1. Core Security Philosophy

Harvey OS's security philosophy is rooted in the principle of **simplicity and minimalism**, drawing inspiration from Plan 9. We believe that complexity is the enemy of security. By maintaining a small, auditable codebase and clear, explicit interfaces, we aim to reduce the attack surface and make vulnerabilities easier to identify and mitigate.

However, simplicity alone is not sufficient in modern, networked environments. Therefore, we augment this with proven security best practices, including defense-in-depth, principle of least privilege, and secure defaults.

## 2. Threat Model

The threat model for Harvey OS considers the defined target use cases from the `ARCHITECTURAL_MANIFESTO.md`.

### 2.1. General Threats (Applicable to most use cases)
*   **Network-based attacks:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) against network services.
    *   Intrusion attempts (exploiting vulnerabilities in network daemons or the kernel's network stack).
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks on network communications.
    *   Packet spoofing and session hijacking.
*   **Local privilege escalation:**
    *   Exploiting kernel vulnerabilities to gain root access from an unprivileged process.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in setuid/setgid binaries.
*   **Data compromise:**
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored on the device.
    *   Unauthorized access to data in transit.
*   **Malware:**
    *   Introduction of malicious code onto the system.
*   **Supply chain attacks:**
    *   Compromise of build tools or third-party libraries.

### 2.2. Use Case-Specific Threats

**a) Secure Embedded IoT Gateway:**
*   **Physical tampering:** Unauthorized physical access to the device to extract data or modify firmware (partially mitigated by hardware choices, focus on OS hardening).
*   **Compromise of connected sensors/devices:** An attacker using a compromised sensor to attack the gateway.
*   **Interruption of data forwarding:** Preventing critical data from reaching upstream systems.

**b) Network Security Appliance (Firewall/IDS):**
*   **Evasion of detection/filtering:** Crafting malicious traffic to bypass firewall rules or IDS signatures.
*   **Attacks on the management interface:** Gaining unauthorized administrative access.
*   **Resource exhaustion attacks:** Overwhelming state tables or logging capacity.

**c) OS Research & Education Platform:**
*   **Unintentional system instability:** Due to experimental code or misconfiguration by users. (Security focus here is on isolation if multi-user, and clear warnings).
*   **Intellectual property theft:** (If research involves sensitive code/data - less of an OS security issue, more a deployment concern).

### 2.3. Attack Vectors Considered
*   Network interfaces (all protocols).
*   System calls and kernel interfaces.
*   User-mode applications and daemons, especially those running with elevated privileges.
*   File system manipulation.
*   Authentication mechanisms.
*   Update mechanisms.

### 2.4. Assets to Protect
*   System integrity (kernel, critical system files).
*   Confidentiality and integrity of user and system data (at rest and in transit).
*   Availability of critical system services.
*   Administrative access control.

## 3. Security Principles

1.  **Minimize Attack Surface:**
    *   Run only essential services by default.
    *   Reduce code complexity; prefer small, single-purpose utilities.
    *   Limit exposure of kernel interfaces.
2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Processes should run with the minimum privileges necessary.
    *   Fine-grained permissions where possible (e.g., Plan 9's per-process namespaces).
    *   Avoid running services as root whenever feasible.
3.  **Secure Defaults:**
    *   Configure the system to be secure out-of-the-box.
    *   Default deny firewall policies (for appliance use case).
    *   Strong default passwords (if applicable) or mandatory change on first boot.
4.  **Defense in Depth:**
    *   Employ multiple layers of security controls.
    *   E.g., network filtering, process isolation, file system permissions, integrity checking.
5.  **Explicit is Better than Implicit:** Security policies and configurations should be clear and understandable.
6.  **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   Use memory-safe practices (e.g., bounds checking, avoid deprecated functions). C17 features should be leveraged.
    *   Input validation for all external data.
    *   Regular code audits for security vulnerabilities.
7.  **Fail Securely:** If a component fails, it should do so in a way that does not compromise the overall security of the system.
8.  **Cryptographic Best Practices:**
    *   Use strong, vetted cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    *   Proper key management.
    *   Protect data in transit with protocols like TLS.
9.  **Regular Updates and Patch Management:** Provide a mechanism for secure updates (though the specifics are part of Release Engineering).
10. **Auditing and Logging:** Maintain sufficient logs for security event analysis and forensics (configurable verbosity).

## 4. Security Validation Procedures

1.  **Static Analysis:**
    *   Regularly run tools like `clang-tidy` (with security checks enabled), and other specialized static analyzers on the codebase.
    *   Incorporate static analysis into the CI pipeline.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis:**
    *   Employ fuzz testing (fuzzing) for critical system calls, network parsers, and file format handlers.
    *   Use sanitizers (ASan, UBSan, TSan) during development and testing builds.
3.  **Code Reviews:**
    *   All code changes, especially to security-sensitive components, must undergo peer review with a focus on security implications.
    *   A checklist for security code reviews should be developed.
4.  **Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   Periodically scan the system using standard vulnerability scanners (e.g., OpenVAS, Nessus) against known CVEs, particularly for any third-party components.
5.  **Penetration Testing (Conceptual for now):**
    *   For mature versions or specific security-critical deployments, consider engaging external or internal teams for penetration testing.
6.  **Security Regression Testing:**
    *   Develop test cases for previously identified vulnerabilities to ensure they are not reintroduced.
7.  **Documentation Review:** Ensure all security features and configurations are clearly and accurately documented.

This security model is a living document and will be updated by the ARB as Harvey OS evolves and new threats emerge.
