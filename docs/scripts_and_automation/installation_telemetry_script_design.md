# Design: installation-telemetry.sh (Conceptual)

## 1. Purpose

The `installation-telemetry.sh` script (or a similar mechanism) is envisioned to collect anonymized data about the success rates, timings, and common failure points of the Harvey OS installation process, specifically the execution of `setup-harvey-dev-env.sh`. This data would be invaluable for identifying areas where the setup script or installation guide can be improved.

**Note:** Implementation of telemetry must prioritize user privacy and be opt-in. This document describes the *design and intent*, not a mandate for data collection without consent.

## 2. Conceptual Design & Features

*   **Data Collection Points (within `setup-harvey-dev-env.sh` or a wrapper):**
    *   Script start and end times.
    *   Success/failure status of each major phase (e.g., "Phase 1: System Foundation - SUCCESS/FAILURE").
    *   Time taken for each phase.
    *   Specific error codes or messages if a phase fails (anonymized).
    *   Host OS detected (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 12 - no personally identifiable info).
    *   Whether running in Docker.
    *   Hash of `setup-harvey-dev-env.sh` script version.
*   **Data Transmission (Opt-In):**
    *   At the end of `setup-harvey-dev-env.sh`, if telemetry is enabled (e.g., via an environment variable `HARVEY_TELEMETRY_OPT_IN=true` or a command-line flag passed to the setup script), the collected data would be sent to a secure, project-controlled endpoint.
    *   The process must be transparent to the user.
*   **Data Storage & Analysis:**
    *   Data stored anonymously.
    *   Regular analysis to identify:
        *   Most common failure points/phases.
        *   Phases that take the longest.
        *   Differences in success rates across OS versions or Docker vs. native.
*   **Output (Local):**
    *   The `setup-harvey-dev-env.sh` would still produce its local `installation-report.txt` and `harvey-status.txt` irrespective of telemetry opt-in.
    *   The telemetry script itself (`installation-telemetry.sh`) might be a helper called by the main setup script to format and send data if opted-in.

## 3. Integration

*   Logic embedded or called from `setup-harvey-dev-env.sh`.
*   Clear documentation on how to opt-in or opt-out, and what data is collected.

## 4. Privacy Considerations (Crucial)

*   **Anonymity:** No IP addresses, hostnames, usernames, or other PII should be collected.
*   **Transparency:** Users must be informed about what data is collected and why.
*   **Opt-In:** Data collection must be strictly opt-in.
*   **Security:** Endpoint for data submission must be secure.
*   **Data Usage Policy:** Clear policy on how collected data is used (solely for improving installation process) and for how long it's retained.

This conceptual design aims to provide a feedback loop for improving the installation experience, always respecting user privacy.
