# Plan-H Documentation Suite: Conceptual Review Summary
# Plan: Synthesized Plan - Harvey OS Documentation Integration & Operationalization

This document summarizes the files created and significantly modified during the execution of the "Synthesized Plan: Harvey OS Documentation Integration & Operationalization." It also reiterates the key principles that guided these documentation efforts, serving as a checklist for a conceptual final review before submission.

## 1. Documents Created or Significantly Modified in this Plan:

### Potentially Superseded/Refactored Older Documents:
*   `docs/architectural-manifesto.md` (Moved to root and became v2.0)
*   `docs/systematic-modernization.md` (Refactored to point to new, specific guides for C17 migration and deprecation)
*   `docs/ci-strategy.md` (Updated to integrate with new performance baseline strategy)
*   (Others like `c17-roadmap.md`, `acd-plan9-audit.md`, `modernization-plan.md` would be candidates for formal deprecation marking in the final submission step).

## 2. Key Guiding Principles for Review:

This documentation suite should reflect the following principles, as emphasized in user feedback:

*   **Single Source of Truth:** Information should exist in one primary place, with other documents linking to it.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Information should be structured to reveal complexity as the user is ready for it (e.g., `DEVELOPER_JOURNEY.md` guiding to details, installation guide steps).
*   **Automated Verification (Conceptualized):** The design documents for automation scripts aim to support this principle by ensuring documentation and code stay aligned.
*   **Error Resilience:** The installation guide documents (01-10) now include "Troubleshooting and Recovery Procedures" sections.
*   **Architectural Context:** The installation guide documents (01-10) now include "Architectural Alignment" sections, linking procedures back to strategic architectural documents.
*   **Navigability:** The root `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_JOURNEY.md`, and `docs/installation_guide/README.md` should provide clear pathways through the documentation.
*   **Quantitative & Executable Details:** The `ARCHITECTURAL_MANIFESTO.md` (v2.0) and its supporting documents should contain specific, measurable criteria and actionable procedures.
*   **Clarity and Consistency:** Uniform style, clear language, and consistent linking.

## 3. Conceptual Completion

The creation and modification of these documents represent the fulfillment of the content generation and refinement tasks based on the detailed "Strategic Integration Framework" and "Strategic Refinement Protocol" feedback. The next step (Step 10 of the plan) is the conceptual submission of these assets.

## 4. Plan Execution Summary: "Plan-H Final Documentation Polish and Integration"

**Date of Execution:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Objective:** To address critical feedback on the v2.0 documentation suite, focusing on project identity migration to "Plan-H", enhancing key documents with robustness and discoverability metadata, and creating final bridging/preparatory documents.

### Key Deliverables & Actions in this Plan:

1.  **Project Identity Migration to "Plan-H" Documented:**
    *   Created `scripts/migrate-to-plan-h.sh` (script content for manual execution).
    *   Created `docs/project/project_identity_migration.md` (explaining the name change).
    *   All subsequent document modifications and new content in this plan have adopted "Plan-H" nomenclature.

2.  **Enhanced Validation Script in Installation Guide:**
    *   Modified `docs/installation_guide/10_basic_validation_next_steps.md` to include a more robust `plan-h-validate-complete.sh` example with dynamic kernel discovery.

3.  **Automation Script Implementation Status Document Created:**
    *   Created `docs/scripts_and_automation/implementation-status.md` to track the status of conceptualized automation scripts and provide a suggested implementation roadmap.

4.  **"Day 2 Operations Guide" Created:**
    *   Created `docs/operations/day2-development-workflow.md` to guide developers on ongoing development tasks post-installation.

5.  **YAML Front Matter Added to Key Documents:**
    *   Added discoverability metadata (YAML front matter) to:
        *   `ARCHITECTURAL_MANIFESTO.md` (Plan-H Manifesto)
        *   `DEVELOPER_JOURNEY.md`
        *   `docs/installation_guide/README.md`
        *   `docs/architecture/tier-criteria.md`
        *   `docs/community/contribution-guide.md`

6.  **Submission Checklist Document Created:**
    *   Created `docs/project/SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` to serve as a final review tool before committing the entire v2.0 documentation suite.

7.  **Migration Announcement Text Drafted:**
    *   Created `docs/project/ANNOUNCEMENT_PLANH_DOCS_V2.md` with draft text for announcing the documentation suite and the Plan-H name change.

8.  **Conceptual Review of Linkages and "Plan-H" Naming:**
    *   Ensured consistent "Plan-H" naming and coherent linking in all content generated/modified during this plan. (This was an ongoing principle).

9.  **This Update to `documentation_review_summary.md`**.

**Outcome:** This plan has addressed the final layer of feedback, focusing on establishing the "Plan-H" identity, refining critical components like the validation script, bridging documentation gaps (Day 2 guide, script status), and adding important metadata for discoverability and project management. The documentation suite is now conceptually complete and aligned with the new project identity.
