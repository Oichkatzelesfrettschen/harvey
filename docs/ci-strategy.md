# Continuous Integration (CI) Strategy for Multi-Architecture Validation

## 1. Introduction

*   This document outlines the strategy for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) for Harvey OS, focusing on robust multi-architecture validation.
*   It addresses the need for comprehensive testing across the supported architectural tiers defined in the "Architectural Manifesto."
*   The goal is to ensure stability, catch regressions early, and provide reliable builds for developers and users.

## 2. Current CI Overview and Gaps

*   Briefly describe the existing CI setup (e.g., GitHub Actions in `ci.yml`).
*   Identify gaps based on the "Architectural Manifesto":
    *   Limited architecture testing (currently x86_64, i386, arm64).
    *   Lack of testing for Tier 2 and Tier 3 architectures.
    *   No systematic performance regression testing in CI.
    *   Build environment inconsistencies ("Environmental Resilience" from the review).

## 3. Proposed CI Enhancements

### 3.1. Tiered Build and Test Strategy

*   **Tier 1 (Core Architectures - e.g., x86_64, arm64):**
    *   Full build and comprehensive test suite execution on every commit/pull request.
    *   Performance benchmark execution on a nightly or weekly basis.
    *   Builds must pass for changes to be merged.
*   **Tier 2 (Community Supported Architectures):**
    *   Full build validation on every commit/pull request.
    *   Test suite execution on a nightly or weekly basis, or triggered manually.
    *   Build failures will be reported but may not block merging initially, depending on community maintainer availability.
*   **Tier 3 (Experimental/Legacy Architectures):**
    *   Build validation on a weekly basis or manually triggered.
    *   Failures are informational and highlight bit-rot or deprecation issues.

### 3.2. Build Environment and Toolchains

*   **Containerized Builds:**
    *   Utilize Docker or a similar container technology for all CI builds.
    *   Define per-architecture Docker images that include the precise toolchains and dependencies required. This ensures:
        *   **Consistency:** Builds are reproducible and not affected by the CI runner's environment.
        *   **Environmental Resilience:** Addresses the "temporal anomaly" issue by locking down dependencies.
    *   These Docker images will be versioned and maintained in a separate repository or alongside the Harvey OS source.
*   **Toolchain Management:**
    *   For cross-compilation, toolchains will be installed within the containers.
    *   Strategy for Offline-Capable Toolchain Mirrors:
        *   Investigate setting up an internal package/toolchain mirror (e.g., using Artifactory, Nexus, or simple web storage).
        *   Container images would be pre-configured to use these mirrors first, falling back to public sources only if necessary. This mitigates external outages.

### 3.3. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Tests:** Executed for all relevant architectures.
*   **Integration Tests:** Focus on interactions between components within Harvey OS.
*   **POSIX Conformance Tests:** (As per `docs/systematic-modernization.md`) Phased introduction into the CI for relevant components and architectures.
*   **Emulation for Non-Native Targets:**
    *   Utilize QEMU for running tests for architectures not natively supported by CI runners (e.g., ARM64 tests on x86_64 runners).
    *   QEMU setup will be integrated into the container images for those specific architectures.

### 3.4. Performance Regression Testing

Performance regression testing is a critical component of the CI pipeline for Tier 1 architectures. This process is detailed in the **[Harvey OS Performance Baselines and Regression Strategy](docs/architecture/performance-baselines.md)** document.

In summary, the CI workflow will:
1.  Build the OS on a reference environment (using containerized builds on defined reference hardware).
2.  Execute standardized reference workloads as defined in `docs/architecture/performance-baselines.md`. These workloads simulate key aspects of our target use cases.
3.  Compare the performance metrics (e.g., throughput, latency, resource utilization) from these workloads against established, version-controlled baselines for that specific architecture and hardware profile.
4.  Fail the build and generate a detailed report if significant regressions are detected. A regression is defined as performance degrading beyond a set threshold (e.g., >5% for key metrics) or failing to meet the explicit acceptance criteria defined for the workload and architecture in `docs/architecture/performance-baselines.md`.
5.  Nightly or weekly builds on Tier 1 architectures will execute the full suite of performance workloads. The historical performance data from these runs will be stored to feed into a Performance Dashboard, allowing for tracking of performance trends over time.
6.  Pull request builds for Tier 1 architectures may run a subset of critical, quick-to-execute performance workloads to provide faster feedback, with the full suite run upon merge or nightly.

### 3.5. Artifact Management

*   Successful builds for Tier 1 (and potentially Tier 2) architectures will produce release artifacts (e.g., images, binary packages).
*   Artifacts will be versioned and stored securely (e.g., GitHub Releases, dedicated artifact repository).

## 4. Implementation Phases

*   **Phase 1 (Short-term):**
    *   Develop Docker images for current Tier 1 architectures (x86_64, i386, arm64).
    *   Update `ci.yml` to use these containerized builds.
    *   Expand `ci.yml` matrix to explicitly reflect Tier 1 status.
*   **Phase 2 (Mid-term):**
    *   Implement QEMU-based testing for arm64 (if runners are x86_64).
    *   Begin work on defining and integrating performance benchmarks.
    *   Start developing Docker images for selected Tier 2 architectures.
*   **Phase 3 (Long-term):**
    *   Establish toolchain/package mirrors.
    *   Full implementation of tiered build strategy across all defined architectures.
    *   Integrate POSIX conformance tests.

## 5. Future Considerations

*   Distributed builds for faster feedback.
*   Automated deployment for certain components/packages.

This strategy aims to create a robust, reliable, and scalable CI process that supports Harvey OS's multi-architecture goals and ensures high-quality releases.
