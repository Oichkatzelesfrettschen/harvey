# Code Quality Report

This document summarizes findings from static analysis and manual code review.

## `modern/` Directory (Analyzed with clang-tidy)

Analysis of the `modern/` directory was performed using `clang-tidy` with the project's `.clang-tidy.config` and the `-DUSE_POSIX_THREADS -D_GNU_SOURCE` flags.

The core files `modern/acd.c`, `modern/args.c`, and `modern/spinlock.c` (and their respective headers) passed `clang-tidy` checks without error according to the current configuration.

All reported issues (23 warnings treated as errors) are concentrated in **`modern/plan9_compat.h`**:

1.  **`bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters`**:
    *   **Locations**: Several functions like `send()`, `recv()`, `mkalt()`.
    *   **Description**: Parameters (e.g., channel pointer, value pointer, size) might be inadvertently swapped by the caller due to similar types.
    *   **Severity**: Medium.

2.  **`readability-identifier-length`**:
    *   **Locations**: Throughout `plan9_compat.h`.
    *   **Description**: Use of short variable names (e.g., `m`, `c`, `v`, `a`, `i`, `t`, `ch`). This is characteristic of Plan 9 C style.
    *   **Severity**: Low (Style).

3.  **`readability-braces-around-statements`**:
    *   **Locations**: Several `if`, `while`, `for` statements with single-line bodies.
    *   **Description**: Missing curly braces around single-statement blocks.
    *   **Severity**: Low (Style/Best Practice).

4.  **`clang-analyzer-security.insecureAPI.DeprecatedOrUnsafeBufferHandling` (for `memcpy`)**:
    *   **Locations**: `send()` and `recv()` functions using `memcpy`.
    *   **Description**: `memcpy` is flagged as potentially unsafe by the static analyzer. The current usage appears to correctly use `ch->size`, but the API itself is considered prone to misuse if sizes aren't managed carefully.
    *   **Severity**: Medium (Potential Risk).

## `acme/bin/source/acd/` Directory

A full `clang-tidy` analysis was not feasible due to numerous errors related to Plan 9 specific types and missing headers not compatible with a standard C17 environment. A manual review is pending to identify specific Plan 9 dependencies.

**Initial Observations (from file structure and `mkfile`):**
*   This component is a CD player utility.
*   It uses a Plan 9 `mkfile` structure, implying deep integration with Plan 9 build system and libraries.
*   Likely uses Plan 9 graphics libraries (`<libg.h>`) and system calls.

## `386/include/` Directory

A full `clang-tidy` analysis was not feasible due to Plan 9 specific types and missing headers.

**Initial Observations (from previous reviews):**
*   Contains Plan 9 specific headers (e.g., `u.h`, `ureg.h`) and APE (POSIX environment for Plan 9) headers.
*   Some headers like `u.h` have been partially modernized to use C17 types (e.g., `uint32_t` for `ulong`).
*   Headers like `ureg.h` are inherently x86-specific.
*   These headers are not currently included by code in the `modern/` directory.
